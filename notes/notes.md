- C: hi everyone
- J: were excited to be here. were excited to show you all this cool new stuff. we wanted to show you a cool demo. 
- C: but we struggled to come up with a demo that could be all encompassing. we all love petclinic, but we've all seen it already. 
- J: right. so we wanted to come up with something new, but in the same spirit. 
- C: how about an dog adoption service?
- J: that works. 
- C: who doesnt love dogs?
- J: i love dogs. except my dog. he's the worst. he's a furry fascist. a tiny tyrant! he leaves his little yellow rubber duckies all around the floor and lunges at anybody who deigns approach them, like he owns the place. 
- C: if he's so horrible why do you keep him? 
- J: well, there are 2 reasons:  ego; and of course he's sickeningly cute 
- C: that reminds me of this dog i read about during the pandemic, named Prancer. did you ever see this? this lady was trying to rehouse her dog. she says "there's not a market for..." and continues "he is like a vessel for a huanted victorian child" and adds ominously that prancer wants to be your only child.. not good
- J: hah! that does sound like Peanut. i wonder if theyre related.
- C: we should build something to help house all doggos. 
- J: yah! every dog deserves a good home. even Peanut and Prancer. and lets start our jo8urney as always on my second favorite place on the internet...  (start.spring.io)
